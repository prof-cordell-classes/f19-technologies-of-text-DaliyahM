**1). Process Description**:   

In continuation to our previous lab creating Twitter bots, we gave our poems a physical form through type. We began this lab by revisiting our bots’ feed by choosing one of the tweets that we would like to print for our class anthology. I went through my Twitter feed and found the post _“you may bake her underground in fries, with your sweet sugary ties”_. I chose this tweet in particular because I thought it was not only comical, but it also follows the rhyme scheme from the opening couplet of Maya Angelou’s _Still I Rise_. We were also given an introduction on the different operations that are involved in setting type. For this particular lab, we utilized a compositor stick to compile the type and a 20 piece of lead to separate our lines of type. After examining the variety of typefaces in the room, I settled on _Melior Italic_, because I felt that it would be formally expressive in contrast to the humorous literature.   
 
While setting the type, I held the composing stick at an angle in my left hand and picked up the type with my right hand. We used the [California Job Case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_job_case), with a diagram of the layout to assist us in choosing the correct letters and punctuation for our poems. In the orientation of the composing stick facing you, you have to set the type right to left, in reading order. With that being said, each individual piece of type had a small nick that should be facing you as you are setting the type. In order to create spaces between each piece of type, you have to utilize quads(spaces), which don’t have to necessarily be the same height as your intended typeface, but they do have to take the same width. Finally, when you are done setting your type, the block should be movable after applying pressure to the perimeter of the lead sticks.   


**2). Observations**:  
  
Initially, I was completely confused about the orientation of the type in terms of setting from right to left, in reading order. I couldn’t conceptualize how setting in that order would print in a manner that would be readable from left to right. Eventually, I realized that we were creating a mirror image of our type, so that it would be in the correct manner when it was finally inked and on the paper. Following my revelation in terms of the orientation of the type, I was also confused by the use of quads and how the spacing would show up in the imprinted copy. I didn’t know what decisions to make in terms of spacing because I felt as though I would place different sized quads between my words and too much spacing at the end of my lines. In the end, I decided to just estimate similar sized quad blocks between my words and make sure that the spacing at the ends of my lines were congruent as well.   

Ultimately, all went well with my typesetting, until I was “done” and went to go print and realized that I had accidentally used a _u_ for an _n_ (and vice versa) in the word “underground” for my poem. ![image of typesetting](/images/IMG_0853.HEIC).       
Luckily, our professor was able to successfully extract the letters and switch their spaces before the official printing had begun. From this, I learned the vital importance of proofreading your type prior to printing in order to prevent errors and delays in the press. 

**3). Analysis**:  

Personally, aside from the typesetting and printing process, one of the most exciting processes of this lab in terms of creativity was choosing the typeface. Being able to explore the different typefaces for individual letters out of each job case was particularly freeing because it gave me a sense of agency on how I would personally delegate the presentation in the printing of my poem. Typically, students are asked to type in Times New Roman 12 point font, to submit formal work to professors and other professionals. The format of this lab gave us the power to choose a typeface, which allowed us to make our own arguments for our poem and how we want it to be shown through print. For instance, for my specific poem, I wanted the formality of the typeface to juxtapose the humor in the poem to make it comical, as well as an ode to the original profound work written by the late Maya Angelou.   
  
Similarly, when I am working on my own projects, I tend to explore different fonts on Word or Google Docs when I am given that agency through creativity to decide what argument I want to make through my composition.    
 
With that being said, I agree strongly with the idea presented by Gayomali in [_How Typeface Influences the Way We Read and Think_](https://theweek.com/articles/463196/how-typeface-influences-way-read-think),  

>“Words hold power. But the aesthetic manner in which those words are presented can affect the way we read, and the way we think about the information presented”(Gayomali, _The Week_).   
   
I think that even our own handwriting can prove different means of presentation and create a different argument for our text and how it is perceived by others. It's interesting how something as physically small as the type that we chose can prescribe different means of interpretation. Furthermore, for this specific lab, I was grateful that the particular typeface that I chose was Large-24 point so that it could be large enough to read on the page along with other poems. Overall, after completing this portion of the lab, I learned about the diligence that goes into composition in the printing press as well as the multitude of creative  possibilities within the typesetting realm.
