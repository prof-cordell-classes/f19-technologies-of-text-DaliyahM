**1). Process Description**:   
   
Prior to the lab, we explored the [_Touch this Page_](https://touchthispage.com/about-us) website which is a multi-sensory experience featuring 3D books that were printed for the blind and people with impaired vision, between 1830 and 1910. For our lab, we used 3D printed versions replicas of a few pages of different books that were presented in the exhibit. In order to maximize our sense of touch in this lab, which would be the primary sense used while reading the books, we could not look at the 3D prints while we felt the page. We went around the classroom in groups and felt the different models without a visual representation of the size and layout of the text. When I first placed my hand over the text on the top left side of the page, I automatically assumed that it would be in similar reading order to a book. I did not consider the different possibilities of reading text and how that might be transferred onto 3D prints.      

   
**2). Observations**:   

When I first read about Boston Line Type, and I saw the images online, I thought it would be easier to read the print by touch, because the letters “looked” similar to the way we would read them on the page. Eventually, I discovered after completing this lab that the different fonts were often difficult to decipher without looking directly at the page. While reading the 3D prints, we didn’t just have to consider the different fonts, but also the chance that another language may be represented and the fact prints can also feature imagery along with the text. With that in mind, while I was feeling over the blocks I had to consider the multitude of possibilities that could’ve been present on the given page. I think that if I knew the medium that was presented on every page (text, image, characters), I would’ve been able to make a more educated guess on what I was feeling.    
 
I found it frustrating that some of the characters were extremely small and often placed close together with the next sequence of characters. From this, I couldn’t really distinguish the differences between the characters and whether or not there were spaces between words. It is also interesting to note that the 3D replicas were actually twice the size of the original, and knowing this I probably wouldn’t be able to decipher any of the text from the original format. In general, I don’t typically “read” using my fingers, so I may have just had a harder time comprehending that motion over trying to contextualize the information. However, I do understand how physically looking at the text can work as one method while someone who has an impaired vision may touch the print. In contrast, although I am not blind, I think that this technique of Boston Line Type may have not been as successful as braille because of the multitude of factors that play a role in reading the type, rather than reading a standardized format of dots.   
 
**3). Analysis**:   

When thinking about this lab and how it relates with the ideas we’ve discussed in class, I often think of medium and how that attributes too so much of the knowledge we acquire today. More specifically, although our experiences with learning may vary, we are all still exposed to varying forms of tangible media that allows us to learn more about the world in which we inhabit. These mediums (for example: the phone, newspapers, computers) also make learning more individualized and personal to our own capacities. However, when these forms of media are inaccessible, or limited from our scope, we are then left to think of alternative ways to acquire information and communicate our ideas with society.   
 
For instance, the [_Universal Page_](https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/the-universal-page/) goes through the history of braille and Boston Line Type, and how the different mediums were used in society. I thought it was particularly interesting when the author noted that _“In 18th century Europe, before braille was invented, blind people weren’t even taught to read at all”_ (Leland). I thought that was interesting in relation to medium and accessibility because it proves that there was a time where the established medium (books) were only created for the a specific group of people. Those that could afford books and those that could read books using their vision.     
 
I think that the creation of braille established a sense of difference and uniqueness, aside from the Boston Line Type that generally enforced a sense of “normalcy” (Davis, _bending over backwards_). Although Howe’s intentions were valid, as he wanted the medium to be “readable” for those with or without vision impairment, and it did contribute to the ideas surrounding "universal media", I think that it lacks the accessible nature needed for those that are visually impaired. While all technology may be "assistive technology" (Hendren, _All Technology is Assistive_), we also have to consider the audience that requires this assistant first and then branch over to universal technology. Overall, I do believe that there should be universal mediums that can be shared through different groups of people to promote access to literacy and sharing information.
