### Lab Report: _MARK DOWN_

**1). Process Description**: 
 
We began the lab with an introduction to Github, a software development service, and the prominent application that we will be using throughout the course over our various class activities. We went over the definitions of terms such as _repository_, _commit_, and a general overview of the different purposes of the service. After discussing the importance and collaborative initiatives used within the app, we downloaded the desktop version to our laptops and began to experiment within the class’ established repository. I duplicated the templates that the professor had provided within the lab report folder to explore the markdown language and the different possibilities of customization when I begin to submit my own work. I used the Wikipedia page on [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) for references to the general syntax available for my use. Through the use of asterisks, underscores, and the precise placement of spaces I was able to discern several possibilities within the Markdown syntax. I experimented with different keys to create  _italics_, `monospace type`, and utilize the horizontal rule. Ultimately, through this exercise I was able to discover different ways that I could express my writing through the attributes of the Markdown language. I copied my work onto [Hashify](https://hashify.me/IyBUaXRsZQ==), the online application that allows you to preview your documents in plain text before committing to publish on Github. From there, I continued to go back and forth between my edits in Markdown and on Hashify to test different methods for syntax within the app.  

  
**2). Observations**:  

Initially, I was confused by the way in which we would utilize the Github application in this class for reading prep and lab reports until we started working individually with the app. More specifically, I was confused by the use of markdown to share and collaborate on ideas. After working with the application, I came to the understanding that markdown creates a general basis for everyone committing to the repository to work off of. From here, you can build off the syntax to contribute to the overarching project. I think that for an English class that also incorporates labs, this format functions well, because while we are all working on our own individual interpretations of the readings and lab assignments we are able to collectively share those experiences with the entire class through one coherent format. With that, I am already interested to see how the class uses markdown syntax in a variety of different manners to articulate their questions and observations.  

In terms of my own observations during the lab, I was surprised about how generally “basic” the markdown syntax was when I googled different options for utilizing markdown within my own project. Considering that I have had a little work with XML and TEI Encoding, I was expecting a more tiresome process of having to remember to insert start and end tags, and the differences between elements and attributes.For example:   
	<\p>This is the beginning of the end<\p>   

Despite my surprise, this basic level of syntax allows for a more accessible area of markdown reaching a generally larger audience for the Github application. With that, one of my frustrations during the experimental process was the translation of the markdown into the online preview application, [Hashify](https://hashify.me/IyBUaXRsZQ==). When I inserted line breaks by leaving a blank line between my paragraphs some of the spaces between paragraphs would appear larger than others. I went back to my markdown folder to see the issue, and discovered that I had left a different number of spaces between my paragraphs, thus resulting in the differences in my syntax and the preview. Similar to the work I did in TEI, working with markdown will be a trial and error application while I'm still getting use to the language.         


**3). Analysis**:  

Following our first few class discussions on content and medium, I tend to think of how inherently easy it is to consider both when working with Github. In this lab we are being asked to think about how we think about the process of computing lab reports and other class assignments through Github. We are looking towards the medium to see how that affects our understanding and contributions to the course themes and discussions. In this instance, I believe that this quote from Lisa Gitelman’s _Always Already New_ speaks to this observation:
>"it makes no sense to think about 'content' without attending to the medium that both communicates that content and represents or helps to set the limits of what that content can consist of" (Gitelman 7).   

In this manner, writing our lab reports and reading preparation assignments in markdown almost “forces” us to think about the medium that is communicating the language that we share with the rest of the class. I also believe that Gitelman’s point regarding the “limits” of the content, is also imperative in this context because based on the syntax we use in markdown we are limiting ourselves in our own expression of thought. In all forms of writing we can control how the content is communicated, when considering Github, I tend to think more deeply about the presentation of my content through the medium and how it contributes to the arguments made in my writing.   
 
The limits of computational syntax may have also derived from my more general knowledge of basic coding and little study within the overall subject. With that being said, if I had a more robust understanding of the programming software and its possibilities, I probably wouldn’t feel as limited within the creative sphere of my work. This makes me think about our in-class discussion on computer programming as literacy, and how my lack of knowledge regarding markdown and utilizing coding language may be perceived as “illiterate” in the computer coding realm. In contrast, I recognize that media is ever-changing and the possibilities of syntax throughout Github will change with it, meaning that I won't necessarily know every aspect of the language but as long as I can express my ideas with what is available through markdown then my writing will be not limited.   
 
Therefore, in regards to my earlier point discussing content and medium, I think that working through the medium to create the content itself allows myself to think deeper about my purposes when writing prose. For instance, when I'm typing a paper in Microsoft Word I wouldn't think twice about indenting the first line of a paragraph with an indent. Whereas, in markdown I'm considering the format of paper and how it will appear when I post it online before I just indent anywhere within the paper. Utilizing this application for this course, will help me explore the different possibilities of representation through the medium in order to share insightful pieces with the class.
