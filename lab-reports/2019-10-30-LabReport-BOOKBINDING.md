**1). Process Description**:   
   
In continuation with our previous labs with the Twitter bots we created, we moved on to book binding. After we had worked with individual pieces of type, setting the type, and printing individual pages, we are able to put all of that work together into one cohesive piece. We began this lab with a variety of tools including nails, a ruler, a needle and thread, pencils, a bone folder,  and an all. At first, having all of the tools in front of me seemed daunting because it made the task seem even more difficult than it was actually intended. To begin, we started the lab by folding the pages of the Twitterbot poems and the cover page with a bone folder to make finely creased edges. Next, we moved onto measuring out the sections for the threading in order to bind the books. In order to make 5 even sections, for an 8 x 11 inch paper, we made a mark at 4.25 inches as the center of our page and 2 other marks (on both sides) equidistant from the original marking. Following our measurements, we each took our alls and a device to hold the book in place, as we poked the corresponding holes for the binding of our books.  
    
Furthermore, we continued the binding process by cutting off enough thread to loop throw the book. We began with the original hole that we created during our original measurement (at 4.25 inches) to sew the thread through the book to generate a well-designed binding. When we finally finished the sewing pattern, and cut off the excess thread, we had completed our own book bindings of our Twitter bot poems.   
    
**2). Observations**:      

In general, I personally enjoyed this lab because we were able to individually produce our own versions of the class’ book. More specifically, I appreciated the fact that there was no “standard” for the way we ordered the pages in the book, we were able to delegate how we wanted to order the pages and which poems were presented first in our books. I think that because this lab was particularly low stakes because we didn’t have that many pages to bind together, that made it easier to complete this task. However, if we had more pages to work with, it would’ve definitely made it more difficult to poke holes through the pages with the all tool and sew through the defined holes.   
        
In terms of this course, I think it’s interesting how we moved through every step of the publishing process. From generating ideas, to setting type, printing, and binding we were able to see a more succinct version of bringing a book to life. From this experience as a whole, I’ve discovered not only the importance of every aspect of the publishing process, but also the individual work that goes into the process. Although many publishers may not necessarily be setting type anymore, it is important to recognize that these steps were taken to create books from different time periods. It is also interesting despite the changes in time periods, and the methods of publication, we can still come to the same general form of the codex. 

**3). Analysis**:   
    
When thinking about bookbinding, and producing the codex with different materials and it’s attributed value I began to think about this quote from Bonnie Mak’s _Architectures of the Page_:

>“Although a handwritten folio of animal skin in a medieval manuscript is as much a page as the leaf of a mass-produced paperback, the characteristics of each communicate vastly different messages about their respective manufacturer, circulation, and cultural value. In this way, the construction of the page can be read as evidence of its social history” (Mak 3).

I think that because this book was so personal, with our own individual Twitter Bot poems, and taking part in the printing process, the book itself holds more sentimental value to me. However, the materials that we used, as well as the binding process, was not of an expense (in comparison to materials made from animal skin)and I would not consider as valuable from a production perspective. With that being said, I have no issue embellishing the pages or annotating the margins in my own book versus a book that I might have purchased from the store. Personally, I believe that because I technically “authored” a portion of the Twitterbot book I have every right to write inside the book. However, as I have stated in previous lab reports, I have conflicting thoughts about writing in another book that I purchase online or through a bookstore. In terms of the book’s social history, I would love for future generations to be able to interpret the “purpose” of our Twitterbot books and see how they would complete a similar task.   
 
From this, I also began to think about the possibility of creating a digital version (e-book) of the Twitterbot books. I think that in terms of social history, this activity of creating a class e-book may have been read as evidence for the social history of the digital 21st century. Or even creating a different form altogether such as audio books or 3D-printed books, we are establishing different arguments for our social history and the value of these mediums. In conclusion, I really appreciated this lab as it has put the entire printing process into full circle with everything we've read and discussed regarding both modern day publication as well as the history of publication.
