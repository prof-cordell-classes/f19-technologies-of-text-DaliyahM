**1). Process Description**:   
For this lab, we were able to create our own zines, using any topic or theme that we wanted to focus on. I knew that I wanted my zine to have some significance to my identity, I just didn’t know where to start, and what parts of my identity that I wanted to showcase. After we folded the paper up to make our small versions of zines, I began looking through magazines to see if I would be inspired by any of the words or images. Initially, I was just looking for smaller images that interested me, or that I felt matched with my personality. From this, I began to look for different letters to spell out my nicknames, because I feel as though they play a big role in my overall identity. After I looked for letters matching my nicknames, I came to the conclusion that the entire (8-page zine) shouldn’t be about myself, but I should make the other 4 pages about my twin brother. Of course, I came up with this idea towards the end of my zine making process, and I was only able to partially finish three of the eight pages.

**2). Observations**:   
After this lab, I’ve definitely gained more of an appreciation for zine artists, because of the amount of creativity that goes into crafting a zine. Even if the zine is not the most elaborate, piece of work, and it is made out of the cheapest materials, there are still several outlets for creative arguments to be made within the zine. Furthermore, I respect the idea that zines can be presented to an audience size of your choosing, and that your particular zine does not have to be mass produced or even shared with others. In the _Zine Ethics_ reading, the authors make a point that “Because of the often highly personal content of zines, creators may object to having their material being publicly accessible” (Heidy Berthoud, et al). I think that the right of refusal is important for this community because it allows the artist to make their work for as little amount of people as they choose to do so, without any arguments and criticism from others.    
 
Moreover, I thought that the zine making process was interesting because when I did hear everyone else's ideas (in the class) about how they were going to create their zines most of the ideas were either about their identity, or something completely random that they decided to paste on the pages. Personally, I tend to struggle with the idea of compiling “random” images on a page, because it’s hard for me to pin down an actual point or meaning for the work. I enjoyed that my peers were able to liberally choose random images, and not have such a distinct purpose for their zine, but they were still able to collect different elements to make something creative. I think that this lab has taught me to go beyond the boundaries of always having a distinct purpose, or an overall theme, and to be able to think more freely, which could eventually lead to a purpose or a creative idea.   
 
**3). Analysis**:   
    
>_“It wasn’t just a zine, it was a social tool”_ (Kennedy, 27)

I think that one theme that remained consistent throughout most of the zines was that the audience, or the topics within the zine, resonated with minority audiences. I think that it’s important that women, people of color, people within the LGBTQ+ communities, and more, are able to have their voices heard through a creative outlet, if they choose to do so. I also appreciate the fact that you can basically choose everything that you want to go into your zine, and it doesn’t have to be limited by societal standards. Of course, you may still want your zine to appropriate as it can reach multiple audiences (especially if it is found online), but you have the liberty to decide how you want to express your ideas in your zine. I think that this is also important in relation to the publishing process that we discussed earlier in the semester, because with the zine making process you may not necessarily have an editor or someone to proofread your work before it is “published”. With this knowledge, I believe that zine making is a more individualized process in which you can choose to have more assistance if needed, but the individual aspect makes it more personal for the reader.    

I also think that it’s interesting how readers can subscribe to zines (similar to a standard magazine). I think that subscribing to zines gives the writer/creator more of a purpose of continuing to make the zines because they have an audience that are in demand of the content. Whereas, I feel as though if artists did not have zines to subscribe to (such as the one that I created for this class), then they may feel less inclined to continue the theme of that zine onto another edition. However, I also think that those who just create zines for fun can establish a collection of zines that touch on a variety of topics that may go beyond the ideas presented in the zine initially published. Overall, I think that it’s important that zine makers have the choice to publish their work once or multiple times, but this decision is ultimately left up to them.   
 
With that being said, the book’s publishing process and the zine making process still share very similar values in our society. I think that both physical books and magazines are losing a sense of purpose in our everyday lives because everything can be found online. In contrast, these physical objects still hold value, whether that be sentimental value or just presentational value of looking nice on a coffee table or bookshelf. I think that Borsuk makes an important note that “The book… will continue to serve certain kinds of literacy needs and literacy desires - specifically, those related to its book-bound physically and potentiality” (221). In which I would make a similar argument for zines, that even if they are predominantly digital in the upcoming years, they will still serve its purpose for both the intended audience as well as the personal desires of the creator. I think it’s important that zines remain an outlet for creative ideas whether it be a personal endeavor (and your zines are only made and collected for yourself) or if it’s for a particular audience. I believe that zine culture is important for giving a voice to those that may otherwise would not have it, while still allowing voices to remain as quiet as they choose; it still serves an overall purpose.
