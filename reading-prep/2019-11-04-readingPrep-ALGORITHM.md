### **Questions and Observations:**

1). Observation:   
I really appreciated the author’s commentary in the endnotes. The notes reminded me of the annotations that you would see in the margins of a borrowed book. In a way, it seems as though the author is “breaking the fourth wall” by speaking directly to the audience and incorporating contemporary references within the notes (ex: Youtube, Twitter).   

2). Question:    
In the comic, the Queen wondered what the Difference Machine would do to help fight crimes and how the printed algorithms would benefit the economy. What does this mean for computers today? What does the machine do for our society, and in what ways does it benefit us or hurt us?   

3). Observation:  
I realized that although a lot of the comic focused on separating the poetical and imaginary/abstract from logic and mathematics, it is difficult to completely separate the two disciplines. There is logic in the way we compute rhyme schemes in lines of poetry, as well as subjective features of mathematics that could be left for interpretation.
