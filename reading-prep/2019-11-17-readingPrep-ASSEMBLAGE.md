### **Questions and Observations:**

1). Question:    
“... we are returning to a culture that values orality and ephemerality” (Borsuk 258). Are we moving towards a reviving the cycle of using more audio books and orality over conventional codices? Does this mean that memory and oral presentation are also becoming more effective than writing down ideas in order to present them? How do we influence the format of books that we read, and what is out of our control in the future of book publication?    
   
2). Observation:   
I had no idea that zines held a similar amount of rules and copyright privileges as standard books. I always that zines were more of a personal publication that wasn’t actually something that you can you be subscribed too. I wonder if when writers initially write zines they consider the amount of standardized regulations of copyrights that can take effect if they choose to publish their work.   
     
3). Question/Observation:    
I also think it’s interesting how zine creators are always given the right of “refusal” over how their material is distributed. Would it be okay for authors of published novels to refuse for their material to be published for a larger audience than they anticipated? What does this limit of publication mean for both the readers as well as the writer?
