### **Questions and Observations:**

1). Question: _“...the preacher's warning perishes with time, but the scribe's pronouncements will last for many years. The preacher can merely speak to those present, while the scribe preaches even to the future."_ (Trithemius, Chapter 6).   
With the advancements in technology that we have today, does this ideal over the scribe still reign true? While yes, the written word can be physically written down in history, today’s voice recordings/videos can also be used as a medium to educate the future. 
 

2). Question/Observation: A lot of the value attributed to books are a result of the printing press and the time  and effort it took using raw materials to print the physical copies. For instance, the amount of time and people that went into creating the type and printing the paper and vellum copies of Gutenberg's Bible. In the present day, physical copies of codices are no longer an immediate "necessity", and can often be replaced for e-readers or audio books. Are we losing the "value" through the medium of the book from mass production, or is the "value" of the book accounted for by the content? 

  
3). Observation: _“But the aesthetic manner in which those words are presented can affect the way we read, and the way we think about the information presented”_ (Gayomali, The Week).   
I think that society also plays a role in this systematic notion of "formality" in written  work. I believe that if we were told to type in Comic Sans 20 point font to write a formal paper, that would be perceived as the "aesthetically formal" font like _Georgia_ and _Times New Roman_ are today.
