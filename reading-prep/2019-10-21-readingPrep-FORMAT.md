### **Questions and Observations:**


1). Question: After reading Baxter’s _Procrustes_, I began to think of how “angry” I would be to have a copy that had no actual words inside the book. I think that because the company worked so diligently on the actual appearance of the book, the words inside had an increased anticipated “value” because of the intricate embellishment of the book’s cover. Should the other members of the club have thrown their books into the fire and asked Baxter to resign from his position?      

2). Observation: I think that using books as a “prescription” or a prescribed therapy is an interesting topic because it proves not only the power and influence of books but also their purpose in modern times. I think that if we overlook the actual qualities of a book, we tend to forget the value that books hold beyond the written word and basic messages. Even in terms of reading online, instead of going into the doctor’s office, we tend to rely on the internet for more efficient answers rather than paying for another service. 
   
3). Observation: Initially, the interleaf was difficult to read because when I would get to the right side of the page I would forget which line I was reading on the opposite side. The interleaf was also particularly difficult in this format because the lines didn’t line up straight across the page, so it felt like I was jumping around the text to see what lines were next to read. I think that if I was reading this in a newspaper format it would've been easier to read straight across.
