### **Questions and Observations:**


1). Observation: I thought it was interesting when the author notes that “all technology is assisting you” (Hendren) to some degree. Although all methods of technology are not “necessary” to complete our everyday tasks, they are all assisting us in some way when we do choose to use these forms of media. I think it’s also interesting how as technology continues to change it also becomes more and more “necessary” to complete our everyday tasks.

2). Question/Observation: I think Hendren’s article, _All Technology is Assistive: Six Design Rules on Disability_, brings up a good point to create “tools that provide assistance to every human body” (Hendren), and not just creating tools specifically for the able-bodied or the disabled. However, I do think that there should be specialized tools for those that go through dependent stages (or are considered disabled) that could easily be understood for those that are also able-bodied. How do we integrate tools that used for more dependent people into the everyday lives of more independent people?  

3).Questions: In the _End of Books_, Octave Uzanne writes: “to be able at last to close our eyes upon the annihilation of printed things!” (Uzanne). As technology moves to more digital forms of media is this really the end of print? What do we predict will happen at the end of print?
