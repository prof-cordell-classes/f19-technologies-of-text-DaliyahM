### **Questions and Observations:**


1). Observation: 
I enjoyed reading through Jon Bois’ _What Football Will Look Like in the Future_, because of the interactive component of the website. I think that if the text was just simply written up in a typical book format, or printed out, I wouldn’t have enjoyed the reading experience as much as I did reading the story online. In relation to the themes that we’ve discussed throughout the course, I believe that the medium is important in this instance because it enhances the material for the reader. 

2).Question:  
“readers see far greater value in the instant access and quick updates of the web than in the physicality of the printed broadsheet” (Mod, 2015).   
Would you agree that readers find a greater “value” in the quicker access of the internet over physical mediums? Are we equating value with efficiency, rather than acknowledging the multiple layers of “value”? 

3). Observation: 
“To reread is to remember who we once were, which can be equal parts scary and intoxicating” (Mod, 2015).    
I like this quote because I never really thought about rereading a book as rereading apart of my own history. It’s interesting because when I do reread books I often think about how I interpreted the book in the past and how my perspective may have grown or changed completely. This idea regarding “rereading” has definitely made me more inclined to reread more of my older books that I have or older essays that I’ve written to revisit where my head once was in terms of my thought process.
