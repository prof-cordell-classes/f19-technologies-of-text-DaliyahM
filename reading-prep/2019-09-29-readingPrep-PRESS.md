### **Questions and Observations:**


1). Question/Observation: _“Using typography, Walker sought to collapse the ostensible binaries of voice and print”_ (Dinus 57).   
I think that the author is making an interesting point to note that Walker is breaking grammatical structures in order to make his voice heard through his type. This makes me think about how we don’t “necessarily” write how we speak, but if we did, will we be making a more convincing argument for ourselves through our own vernacular? Or should we be confined to writing in a universally “correct” grammatical structure that will generally be accepted by everyone?   


2). Observation: I was particularly confused by the argument that people who borrowed books from other people were considered “Culture vultures” (Price 62). I understand that this was a phrase of it’s time (1931), but it seems a bit radical for someone who may just want to share ideas or explore a different topic of study. It’s interesting how borrowing books (ex: textbooks) today is highly encouraged, and makes more sense rather than everyone buying the same book. Of course, during that time period where the phrase "culture vultures" was used, printing sales were an imperative indication for the writer and the publishing company that their work was satisfactory to the general public.   


3). Observation: It is interesting to note the pattern of the “life of a book”, particularly the idea that books were once viewed as items just to be passed down and borrowed for a short period of time. Then there were also moments in history where the “book” was a sacred form that could only be read by those of privilege, belonging to a particular race, class, or religion. I think it’s just really interesting how Price recognizes that there are several societal and external factors that can affect something as typical and ordinary as a book.
