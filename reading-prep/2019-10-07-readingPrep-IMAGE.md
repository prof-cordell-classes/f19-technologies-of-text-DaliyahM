### **Questions and Observations:**


1). Question/Observation: In the chapter _Book as Idea_, in Borsuk's _The Book_, the author makes an important point to mention that books and ebooks will not last forever (182). With that being said, as we are moving to more technological advances (AR books, animated books), will the codex and mass production remain relevant? Or will the "book" become just merely an "idea" as the future advances. 

2). Observation: I noticed in Blake's _The Marriage of Heaven and Hell_, in the section _Proverbs of Hell_ the different copies show different forms of illuminated printing. For instance, Copy B (Printed in 1790) showcases more muted colors than the intricate colorings and drawings presented in Copy H. I think that when Blake had more time with his work and he mastered his technique, he was able to focus more on embellishing the text.      

3). Observation: I appreciate that William Blake took pride in his extensive printing process by signing "Printing by W. Blake" on his illuminated works. I think that it's important to recognize that he took part in every step of his printing process and selling his books to buy more materials for his books. In relation to another work that we read for a previous class, many women were not recognized for their work in the printing process. After reading about the extent of Blake's effort to print multiple copies in color, and learning to use different materials that were difficult to maneuver, it must've been extremely irritating to not have your name recognized for printing.
