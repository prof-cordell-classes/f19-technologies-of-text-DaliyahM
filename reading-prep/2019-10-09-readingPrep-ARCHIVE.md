### **Questions and Observations:**


1). Question: In _Architectures of the Page_, author Bonnie Mak makes a point to note that, “the characteristics of each (material used to compose a page) communicate vastly different messages about their respective manufacture, circulation, and cultural value” (3). As we are moving to a more digital age, with considerable technological advancements in the way we “read” books, do e-books store “less cultural value” than books that were commonly made out of animal skin and papyrus? More specifically, do books that are made of vastly different materials that we are exposed to today present a more valuable entity than the mass produced codices?
 

2). Observation: Mak also notes that, “The markings on the page are a part of the ‘cultural residue’ left by a battery of authors, scribes, artists, booksellers, book owners, and readers, and can be read as a compelling narrative about the social history of thought” (8). I remember we had a discussion in class on why or why not we may write in our personal books and textbooks. I think that it is sentimental to view markings on a page as a “cultural residue”, because I usually do read the annotations of others in my used books to understand their interpretations of the readings as well. With that being said, markings in the text from other writers can also be a distraction for the reader from the context that they might actually want to focus on. 
    

3). Observation: I noticed that both articles:  _Two Word Books_ and _We’re Taking the Genius of Sequoyah into This Century’: The Cherokee Syllabary, Peoplehood, and Perseverance_ touched on the extinction of particular languages because many people are focused on learning English. I do agree with both authors that language holds cultural ties and it is important to maintain the mother tongue in order to preserve the language for future generations to learn and teach. However, I do understand the argument for a more “universal language” such as English, in order to communicate with others and get work down effectively. It is also interesting how only a small set of languages are typically offered in high schools, while colleges typically offer a wider variety of languages, when language development and comprehension begins at a young age.
