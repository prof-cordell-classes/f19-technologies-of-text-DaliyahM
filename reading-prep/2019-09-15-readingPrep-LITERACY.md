## Questions or Observations


1. QUESTION/OBSERVATION 1: _“The bad scribe does much evil if he will not correct his errors” (Hawk)_
 
Observation: I think that ‘translation’ is an interesting concept, considering that so much is “lost” or misinterpreted through translations, yet, they are necessary for the continuum of the human narrative. Without translations, we would miss out on a variety of stories and potential for areas of information and innovation. I understand Ælfric’s concern regarding translating his work and his emphasis on the writer correcting their errors within the translation before publishing the work to the public. I wonder if Ælfric would be pleased with the translation published on the website, and if another ‘translator’ of Old English texts would recognize any errors in the writing. 


2. QUESTION/OBSERVATION 2: _“In China, an entire mountain can be a book..In this way, even nature can be considered a medium for writing books” (Cai Guo-Qiang, 35) - The Book, Amaranth Borsuk_

In what other ways can nature be used as a means for storytelling? Does the story have to be physically written down or can it be shown through the physical attributes of nature? With the digital age, and more access to technological advances, are we straying away from using nature as a medium for writing books?   


3. QUESTION/OBSERVATION 3: _“... this separation (of thinker and thought) proved essential to the development and dissemination of knowledge in a rapidly growing world” (Borsuk 60)_

Do you agree with Socrates’ argument that writing establishes a separation between thinker and thought, where the writer is separated from his/her work and is no longer able to defend themselves? Or, do you believe that the separation of thinker of thought is imperative for the spread of information in our growing world?
