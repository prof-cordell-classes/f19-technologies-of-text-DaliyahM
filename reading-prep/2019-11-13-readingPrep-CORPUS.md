### **Questions and Observations:**

1). Question:   
Should there be a limit to the amount of variables we account for when we are computing data? For instance, if we are moving away from the male and female binary options, and there are more variables added, does this create a broader data set? Or should there always be a list of every gender option to set as a new baseline for computing data in regards to sexual orientation.   

2). Observation:   
This quote from from _Chapter Three: “What Gets Counted Counts”_ stood out to me: “you always ask questions about the categories that structure your data, and the systems of power that might, in turn, have structured them” (D’Ignazio & Klein). I really appreciated this sentiment because it reminded me that I really do have to consider beyond the surface level ideas that are represented in the data. There are almost always alternatives or other factors to consider when you are analyzing data that you have to consider.   

3). Question:  
What ended the fugitive verses era? What does it mean for an author if they never get recognition for work they’ve written anonymously? This makes me think back to Plato’s _Phaedrus_, when he was concerned with how to “question” or simply converse with author’s through the work when they are gone. Does it matter that there is no particular author attributed to specific poems to discuss their work with? Does it matter that the wrong author may be attributed to particular poems?
